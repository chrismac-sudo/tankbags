## Canadian designer, traveler, farmer, freelancer, and author.

From 2017 through 2018 _Chris MacLuckie_ rode his Morgan mare Roxy on a [375-day solo expedition](https://5000milesofhope.org/) from Canada to Guatemala, then once again back to Central Mexico in 2019.

After several years of working as an English Second Language Teacher and freelancing online, Chris and Roxy returned to Canada to be closer to their roots.

As of 2025, Chris keeps busy designing and developing horse bags and travel gear that embodies the holy triad criteria of [solo horse travel gear](https://tankbags.ca): comfortable, lightweight, and durable.
